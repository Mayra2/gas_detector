# gas_detector
This repository contains the source code and hardware design for a comprehensive Gas Detector System. The system is equipped with a gas sensor to detect hazardous gases, a movement sensor for enhanced functionality, a display for real-time information, a button (taster) for user interaction, and a buzzer for audible alerts.
# Usage
Assemble the circuit based on the provided circuit diagram. It is in PDF file named "Arduino_dokumentacija".
Upload the Arduino sketch (.ino file) to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Power up the system and monitor the real-time gas concentrations and movement detection on the display.
Interact with the system using the button (taster) for configuration or acknowledgment.
Pay attention to audible alerts from the buzzer when gas concentrations reach critical levels.

# Important notice
All documentation, as well as comments in the code, are in Bosnian language
